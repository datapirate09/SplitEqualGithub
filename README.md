# SplitEqual

## Description
SplitEqual is a web based application that is a clone of "SplitWise". It is an application that friends can use when they go on trips with eachother to ensure that all the bills amongst them
have been settled. A person can create groups with any number of people and add their transactions to that group. The application alerts the user if he/she has to pay/receive an amount to/from
another person belonging to that group. Once all transactions have been settled, no more alerts are displayed to the user. The application uses hashing to store personal information of the 
user ensuring password leakage does not occur. The website is built using PERN stack (PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) and EJS.
